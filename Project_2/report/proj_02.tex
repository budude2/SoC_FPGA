\section{Introduction}
In this project I was tasked with creating a design that would scroll text across the 8 digit, 7 segment display. It was required that on power-on the device must load a default message to display and begin scrolling it across the display. In addition, the display must have a mode where the user can program all 8 digits using the 16 switches that were on board. Finally, the device was required to utilize a Block-RAM module for storing the data.  To accomplish this project Vivado 2017.2 was used to simulate, synthesize, and implement System Verilog code for a Basys 4 DDR development board. The design files for this project can be found at \url{https://github.com/txjacob/SoC_FPGA}

Figure \ref{fig:input_logic} shows the input and control logic for the system. The most important module is the controller which is comprised of a state machine that has 8 states: init, load, run, prog0, prog1, inter0, inter1, and load\_reg.
